Picky for pip
=============

This may, at some stage, but potentially never, be a tool for making sure that the packages you have installed
with `pip`__ match those you have specified.

However, it's not getting a lot of love right now, so:

- if you want the original version of picky, please see `those docs`__ and stick to picky 0.9.1.

__ http://picky.readthedocs.io/en/0.9.1/

- look to another tool such and `pip-tools`__ or `pipenv`__.

__ https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip-tools

__ https://docs.pipenv.org/
